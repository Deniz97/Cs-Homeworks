Let's go over some distinction concerning the metaphysical differences between kinesis and energia, process and activity, or as at times when the context is not clear what we will call activity proper or complete activty. We will call energia simply activity when the context permits.

The distinction between those two different ways of actuality is a well known one and there is very little academic dispute over them. Processes are actualities where they are not complete until they are finished. To give an example for process, when walking you can either be walking or have walked, and you can not say you have walked until you finished walking. For energia on the other hand, for example seeing as energia, saying "you are seeing" and "you saw" are the same thing, you can not both be seeing and not saw yet. The distinction will be important through out the essay, aspecially concerning the fact that what is a process can not be the good, as the good is complete in each case. Aristotle will take on the arguments saying that pleasure can not be the good because they are processes, and argue that pleasure are infact energia.
